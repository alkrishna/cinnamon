Hi there!

Cinnamon Package Version 56 is now available.  Please click [here](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04td0000000N1w9) if you want to install this version.

With this version, Cinnamon runs the tests that failed due to timeout error automatically once more before reporting it as a failure.

Please note that this setting is enabled by default.  If you don't want this behavior, you can disable it via Setting tab by adding `advanced=true` parameter and unchecking **Should Rerun Failures**.  

If you see some issues or bugs, please let us know via our [Github Issues](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cinnamon/issues)

Happy testing!
